# Xmrit

Xmrit is the easiest tool to work with the [XmR process-control chart](https://xmrit.com/about/). It is a simple web-based application that allows you to create a chart by pasting in data, interacting with the chart, and sharing it.

A live version of the tool is available at http://xmrit.com/t/ . You can find more details on the tool by reading the [user manual](https://xmrit.com/manual/) or the [integration guide](https://xmrit.com/integration/). All data is stored in your browser and will never be shared with anyone (including us!) as per our [privacy policy](https://xmrit.com/privacy/).

## Getting Started

1. We assume you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/how-to-install-nodejs) environment installed
2. If it is your first time, run `npm install`
3. Otherwise simply run `npm run start` and open your browser at http://localhost:1234.

## Color Customization
You can customize the colors of various chart elements, such as lines, exceptions, and labels.
Look for the 'Customize Chart Colors' section in the application. Changes made here are automatically saved in your browser's local storage and will be applied when you next open the application.
You can also reset the colors to their default values using the 'Reset to Default Colors' button.
